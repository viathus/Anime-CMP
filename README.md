## Introduction

This project is designed as a playground to experiment with and understand different tools and frameworks for building compose multi-platform applications. It is not intended to be the most optimized solution but rather a learning and testing environment.

The app is a simple anime listing application that allows users to browse through a list of anime and view detailed information about each one.

This project follows a similar architecture to the [Nowinandroid](https://github.com/android/nowinandroid) GitHub project. I was inspired by Nowinandroid and decided to create this project following the same approach, though it is not multi-modular but adheres to a similar structure.

## WIP
- Improve performance of compose
- Clean up code to follow clean code architecture
- Handle error states
- Handle loading states
- Handle accessibility

## Supported Platforms
- 📱 iOS
- 🤖 Android
